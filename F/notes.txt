Goal: e/pi0 separation using CNN

Notes:
- start with all of Data Set C
- check for dependence on end-cap activity
	- modify event pre-selection if necessary
- check for dependence on visible energy
	- modify event pre-selection if necessary
- check for dependence on reconstructed pi0 mass
	- add to MLP to possibly improve CNN performance
